# Modern Dotfiles Project Plan

## Overview
Create a highly modular, modern CLI setup using GNU Stow for symlink management. Focus on modern tooling, Rust-based CLI replacements, Neovim with Lua configuration, and a clean, maintainable structure.

**PRIMARY GOALS**:
1. **Safety First**: Non-destructive development on primary machine with easy rollback
2. **Modern Tooling**: Rust-based CLI replacements with coexisting aliases
3. **Claude Code Optimization**: Specialized workflows for agentic CLI development
4. **Vim-Style Navigation**: Consistent vim keybindings and workflow patterns

**SAFETY FIRST**: This is being developed on a primary development machine - all changes must be non-destructive and easily reversible.

## Core Principles
- **Modularity**: Each tool/config in its own Stow package
- **Modern Tooling**: Rust replacements for legacy tools where possible
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized configuration management
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run setup multiple times
- **Iterable**: Easy to add/remove/modify configurations
- **Non-Destructive**: Always backup existing configs, never overwrite without confirmation
- **Incremental Adoption**: Use new tools as they're ready, maintain existing workflow

## Safety Strategy
### Backup and Rollback
- Automatically backup existing dotfiles before any changes
- Create restore scripts for quick rollback
- Use Git to track all changes with detailed commit messages
- Test each component in isolation before integration

### Incremental Migration
- Develop configurations alongside existing setup
- Use aliases to gradually transition to new tools
- Maintain existing tools until new ones are proven stable
- Allow selective adoption of new configurations

### Testing Approach
- Test all new configurations in separate terminal sessions
- Validate tool functionality before switching defaults
- Keep existing configurations as fallbacks
- Document any breaking changes or requirements

## Safety Commands & Procedures

### Before Each Major Change
```bash
# Always backup before changes
./scripts/backup.sh

# Test new configuration
./scripts/test-config.sh [component]

# Apply changes
./scripts/stow-package.sh [package]

# Rollback if needed
./scripts/restore.sh [component]
```

### Emergency Rollback
- Keep existing shell sessions open during testing
- Use `exec $SHELL` to test new shell configs
- Keep backup terminal with original configs
- Document all changes in commit messages

## Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Changes**: One component at a time
- **Parallel Development**: Build alongside, not replace
- **Extensive Testing**: Validate before switching
- **Easy Rollback**: Always have a way back
- **Documentation**: Record every change and decision
- **Validation Scripts**: Automated testing where possible

## Success Metrics
- **Zero Downtime**: Existing workflow never breaks
- **Improved Performance**: Measurable improvements in speed
- **Enhanced Functionality**: New capabilities without losing old ones
- **Easy Maintenance**: Clear upgrade and rollback paths
- **Adoption Flexibility**: Can use new tools at own pace

This approach ensures your development environment stays stable while we build an amazing modern CLI setup!
